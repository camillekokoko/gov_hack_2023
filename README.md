Challenge #1: Increase visitor expenditure through Smart Tourism
--------------------------------
Objective: How can we use digital technology to "upsell" to visitors to South Australia by uncovering additional attractions and experiences and/or extending their stay?

South Australia, a region rich in cultural heritage and natural wonders, is seeking innovative ways to enhance visitor experience. By leveraging digital technology, this challenge calls for solutions that can guide visitors to explore more, stay longer, and uncover hidden gems within the state. Whether it's suggesting local wineries or guiding visitors to indigenous heritage sites, the opportunities are boundless.


How can we create a system that not only satisfies visitors' immediate interests but also entices them to discover more? What digital tools could make this information accessible and appealing? How can this system be integrated into current tourism solutions?


Challenge #2: Highlight the diversity of South Australia's tourism product through gamification
--------------------------------
Objective: How can we apply gamification to engage and educate young (South) Australians about South Australia's diverse tourism product offer and through this, influence key decision makers in their household to discover more of South Australia?

South Australia's diverse landscapes and cultural offerings are a treasure trove waiting to be explored. This challenge aims to harness the power of gamification to engage the young and the curious, inspiring them to learn more about their state and influence family travel decisions.

Can a game be created that educates players about South Australian landmarks, history, and culture? How can this game appeal to both children and adults, becoming a catalyst for real-world exploration? Let's turn the beauty of South Australia into an engaging game and inspire the next generation of explorers.
